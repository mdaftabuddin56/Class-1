            <p>Science is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions 
                about the universe.[1][2]Science may be as old as the human species,[3] and some of the earliest archeological evidence for
                scientific reasoning is tens of thousands of years old.[4] The earliest written records in the history of science come from
                Ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia in around 3000 to 1200 BCE.[5][6] Their contributions to mathematics, astronomy, and medicine
                entered and shaped Greek natural philosophy of classical antiquity, whereby formal attempts were made to provide explanati
                ons of events in the physical world based on natural causes.<br><br>[5][6] After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, knowledge of
                Greek conceptions of the world deteriorated in Western Europe during the early centuries (400 to 1000 CE) of the Middle Ages
                [7] but was preserved in the Muslim world during the Islamic Golden Age</p>

                “A programmer is a person who passes
                as an exacting expert on the basis of 
                being able to turn out, after innumerable punching, 
                an infinite series of incomprehensive answers calculated 

                with micrometric precisions from vague assumptions
                based on debatable figures taken from inconclusive documents
                and carried out on instruments of problematical accuracy by persons
                of dubious reliability and questionable mentality for the avowed 

                purpose of annoying and confounding a hopelessly defenseless department
                that was unfortunate enough to ask for the information in the first place.”

            <p><b><i><u>Earliest roots:</u></i></b> Science has no single origin. Rather, <strong>scientific</strong> methods emerged gradually over the course of <b>thousands of years</b>, taking 
                different forms <em>around the world</em>, and few details are known about the very earliest developments. Some of the earliest evidence
                for scientific reasoning is tens of thousands of years old,[4] and women likely played a central role in prehistoric science,
                [7] as did <mark>religious rituals</mark>.[38] Some Western authors have dismissed these efforts as "protoscientific".[39]Direct evidence
                for <u>scientific processes</u> becomes clearer with the advent of writing systems in early civilizations like Ancient Egypt and 
                Mesopotamia.[5] Although the words and concepts of "<mark>science</mark>" and "nature" were not part of the conceptual landscape at the 
                time, the ancient Egyptians and Mesopotamians made contributions that would later find a place in Greek and medieval science:
                mathematics, astronomy, and medicine.[40][5] From the 3rd millennium BCE, the ancient Egyptians developed a decimal 
                numbering system,[41] solved practical <small>problems using geometry</small>,[42] and developed a calendar.[43] Their healing therapies 
                involved drug treatments and the supernatural, such as prayers, incantations, and rituals.[5</p>
